### Explaining the code
The script first read the files to generate a DataFrame from X train, y train, x Test, y Test, Subject from Train and Subject from Test. The script read too the activiti labels.

The code select only the columns in X Data that have the text mean() and std() to ensure that the mean and standar deviation have been contemplated.

The script makes a merge of train and test data usen a rbind function and then it makes a union of X total data selected previously, activity labels and subject.  With this information is generated a Total Datya Set.

The previous data set is user to generate a tidy Data Set sith the average for each activity and each subject. The new Tidy Data Set is written in a file called TidyMean.csv.
